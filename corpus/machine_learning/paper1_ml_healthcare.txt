Machine Learning in Healthcare: A Comprehensive Review

Abstract: Machine learning has emerged as a transformative technology in healthcare, 
enabling improved diagnostics, personalized treatment plans, and efficient resource allocation. 
This paper reviews the current state of machine learning applications in medical imaging, 
drug discovery, and patient outcome prediction. Deep learning algorithms, particularly 
convolutional neural networks, have shown remarkable accuracy in detecting diseases from 
medical images such as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans. Natural language processing techniques 
are being applied to electronic health records to extract meaningful insights. The integration 
of machine learning with wearable devices enables continuous health monitoring. However, 
challenges remain in data privacy, model interpretability, and regulatory approval. Future 
research should focus on developing explainable AI models that healthcare professionals 
can trust and understand.
