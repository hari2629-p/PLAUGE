Abstract:
This report is an insight into the world of deep learning and CNN networks. It is an attempt to perform classification using neural network and deep learning for a given dataset (which is a subset from the MNIST dataset). The MNIST dataset contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits, divided into 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.
