Abstract:
Here we describe Q-learning, which is one of the most popular methods in reinforcement learning. Q-learning is a type of temporal difference learning.  We discuss other TD algorithms, such as SARSA, and connections to biological learning through dopamine. Q-learning is also one of the most common frameworks for deep reinforcement learning.
