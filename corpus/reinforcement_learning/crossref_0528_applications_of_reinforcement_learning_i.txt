Abstract:
Biometric systems rely on unique human characteristics for secure
identification and authentication. Recently, Reinforcement Learning (RL), a powerful
machine learning technique where algorithms learn through trial and error, has
emerged as a potential game-changer in this field. This chapter explores the exciting
possibilities of utilizing RL to enhance the capabilities of biometric systems, while also
acknowledging the challenges that need to be addressed. Building upon the core
concepts of RL - agents, environments, rewards, and policies - the chapter investigates
its potential applications within the biometrics landscape. We explore areas like
Liveness detection: RL algorithms can be employed to differentiate real-time biometric
presentations, such as fingerprints or facial scans, from fraudulent attempts like photos
or videos; Multimodal biometric authentication: RL can empower systems to
dynamically weigh the contribution of various biometric modalities, like fingerprints,
facial recognition, and iris scans, for more robust and accurate authentication;
Continuous user verification: By enabling systems to learn and adapt throughout user
sessions, RL can be used to continuously verify user identity, improving security and
convenience and Adaptive biometric system optimization: RL can allow for real-time
adjustments to parameters within the biometric system, ensuring optimal performance
under various conditions. By providing a comprehensive analysis of both the potential
applications and the challenges associated with RL in biometrics, this chapter aims to
contribute to a deeper understanding of this emerging field. We believe that fostering
open dialogue and collaboration between researchers, developers, and policymakers is
essential to ensure the responsible exploration of RL in biometrics, paving the way for
a future of secure and trustworthy human-machine interaction.
