Abstract:
The problem of plagiarism in programming assignments by students in computer science courses has caused considerable concern among both faculty and students. There are a number of methods which instructors use in an effort to control the plagiarism problem. In this paper we describe a plagiarism detection system which was recently implemented in our department. This system is being used to detect similarities in student programs.
