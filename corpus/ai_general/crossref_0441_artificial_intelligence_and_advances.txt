Abstract:
This research abstract shares open source theme smart materials and technology for the Current and Future Global Challenges in relation with artificial intelligence which is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. AI will also have a major impact on illegal/illicit /legal harmful drugs, chemicals, toxic herbs and others Control Intervention. the patent pending this scientific computing innovation; will include illegal/illicit/ legal harmful drugs, chemicals, toxic herbs and others Control security system and special purpose computer connected intelligent equipment’s, with sensors capable of taking thousands of measurements throughout the production process and generating billions of data points used to monitor, analyze and control the trafficking process. AI and machine learning are also contributing to the development of next-generation security system, accelerating the development of security intervention for conditions where there are no viable options today. Artificial intelligence promises both to improve existing goods and services, by enabling the automation of many tasks, to greatly increase the efficiency with which they are produced. But it may have an even larger impact on the economy by serving as a new general-purpose method of invention for unique or special tasks; Where Artificial intelligence (AI) clearly lead to better outcomes, already producing benefits and optimizing processes, increasingly sophisticated algorithms and machine learning techniques of data on a particular issue, generate insights, detections and resulting with more efficiency than teams of humans ever could.
