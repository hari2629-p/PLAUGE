Abstract:
There is a wide variety of music similarity detection algorithms, while discussions about music plagiarism in the real world are often based on audience perceptions. Therefore, we aim to conduct a study to examine the key criteria of human perception of music plagiarism, focusing on the three commonly used musical features in similarity analysis: melody, rhythm, and chord progression. After identifying the key features and levels of variation humans use in perceiving musical similarity, we propose a LLM-as-a-judge framework that applies a systematic, step-by-step approach, drawing on modules that extract such high-level attributes.
