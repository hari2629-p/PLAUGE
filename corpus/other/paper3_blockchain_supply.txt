Blockchain Technology in Supply Chain Management

Abstract: Blockchain technology offers unprecedented transparency and traceability in 
supply chain operations. This paper examines how distributed ledger systems can address 
challenges in product authenticity verification, inventory management, and transaction 
efficiency. Smart contracts enable automated execution of agreements between parties, 
reducing intermediary costs and processing time. Case studies from food industry, 
pharmaceuticals, and luxury goods demonstrate successful blockchain implementations. 
The immutable nature of blockchain records ensures data integrity and reduces fraud. 
However, scalability limitations and energy consumption remain significant concerns. 
Integration with Internet of Things devices enables real-time tracking of goods throughout 
the supply chain. The paper proposes a framework for blockchain adoption and discusses 
regulatory considerations for cross-border transactions.
