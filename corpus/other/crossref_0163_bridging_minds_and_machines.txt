Abstract:
Natural language processing (NLP) is a promising field that can revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of psychological disorders. It offers the ability to decode human emotions and mental states through advanced language analysis. This chapter focuses on applying sentiment analysis and identifying linguistic biomarkers to detect early signs of mental health challenges. However, challenges such as data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the difficulty of accurately linking linguistic patterns to clinical outcomes remain. To address these, a novel framework is proposed that synergizes NLP techniques with psychological theories, offering a more interpretable and robust approach to mental health assessment. This strategy uses deep contextual embeddings and real-time sentiment monitoring to provide richer diagnostic insights. Preliminary evaluations show that this approach significantly outperforms traditional models, demonstrating higher accuracy in early detection and enhanced interpretability of results.
