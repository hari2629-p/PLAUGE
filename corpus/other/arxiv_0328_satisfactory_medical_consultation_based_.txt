Abstract:
Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have marked significant progress in understanding and responding to medical inquiries. However, their performance still falls short of the standards set by professional consultations. This paper introduces a novel framework for medical consultation, comprising two main modules: Terminology-Enhanced Information Retrieval (TEIR) and Emotional In-Context Learning (EICL). TEIR ensures implicit reasoning through the utilization of inductive knowledge and key terminology retrieval, overcoming the limitations of restricted domain knowledge in public databases. Additionally, this module features capabilities for processing long context. The EICL module aids in generating sentences with high attribute relevance by memorizing semantic and attribute information from unlabelled corpora and applying controlled retrieval for the required information. Furthermore, a dataset comprising 803,564 consultation records was compiled in China, significantly enhancing the model's capability for complex dialogues and proactive inquiry initiation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the proposed method's effectiveness in extending the context window length of existing LLMs. The experimental outcomes and extensive data validate the framework's superiority over five baseline models in terms of BLEU and ROUGE performance metrics, with substantial leads in certain capabilities. Notably, ablation studies confirm the significance of the TEIR and EICL components. In addition, our new framework has the potential to significantly improve patient satisfaction in real clinical consulting situations.
