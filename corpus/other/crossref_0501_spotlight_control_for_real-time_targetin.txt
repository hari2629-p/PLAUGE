Abstract:
Off-road heavy machinery such as snow groomers or excavators, often operate in low-light and hazardous environments. In this work, we explore the development of an intelligent camera-spotlight system with automatic and manual control to illuminate points of interest, such as obstacles or individuals at risk. We implement a prototype as proof of concept and integrate our workflow using a standard lighting protocol and a single-board computer. The presented calibration of the camera and spotlight ensures high precision in the desired use cases. In addition to testing the prototype on a real snow groomer, we evaluated its performance in terms of accuracy and repeatability. Overall, we showcase the usability of a commercially available spotlight in the context of spatial augmented reality in heavy machinery applications.
