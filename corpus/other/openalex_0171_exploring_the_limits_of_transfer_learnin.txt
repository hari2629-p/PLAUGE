Abstract:
Transfer learning, where a model is first pre-trained on a data-rich task\nbefore being fine-tuned on a downstream task, has emerged as a powerful\ntechnique in natural language processing (NLP). The effectiveness of transfer\nlearning has given rise to a diversity of approaches, methodology, and\npractice. In this paper, we explore the landscape of transfer learning\ntechniques for NLP by introducing a unified framework that converts all\ntext-based language problems into a text-to-text format. Our systematic study\ncompares pre-training objectives, architectures, unlabeled data sets, transfer\napproaches, and other factors on dozens of language understanding tasks. By\ncombining the insights from our exploration with scale and our new ``Colossal\nClean Crawled Corpus'', we achieve state-of-the-art results on many benchmarks\ncovering summarization, question answering, text classification, and more. To\nfacilitate future work on transfer learning for NLP, we release our data set,\npre-trained models, and code.\n
