Abstract:
This paper investigates the efficacy of RWKV, a novel language model architecture known for its linear attention mechanism, for generating sentence embeddings in a zero-shot setting. I conduct a layer-wise analysis to evaluate the semantic similarity captured by embeddings from different hidden layers of a pre-trained RWKV model. The performance is assessed on the Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC) dataset using Spearman correlation and compared against a GloVe-based baseline. My results indicate that while RWKV embeddings capture some semantic relatedness, they underperform compared to the GloVe baseline in terms of Spearman correlation. I also analyze the inference time and GPU memory usage, highlighting the computational trade-offs associated with RWKV embeddings. The findings suggest that while RWKV offers potential advantages in terms of linear scaling, its zero-shot sentence embedding quality for semantic similarity tasks requires further investigation and potential task-specific fine-tuning to match or exceed simpler baselines.
