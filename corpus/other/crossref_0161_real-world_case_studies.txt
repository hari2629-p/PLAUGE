Abstract:
As Natural Language Processing (NLP) is integrated more into mental health care, diagnoses, treatments, and management are changing. An evaluation of practical applications of NLP is presented in this paper, including its potential to enhance accessibility, early detection, and personalized treatment approaches. EHRs and unstructured patient data can be analyzed using NLP. This technology can help clinicians improve diagnosis and treatment. Even so, a number of ethical issues, including privacy and algorithmic bias, continue to pose significant challenges. As well as pointing out its limitations, this study illustrates the transformative potential of natural language processing in mental health care and the future direction that AI should take in this field.
