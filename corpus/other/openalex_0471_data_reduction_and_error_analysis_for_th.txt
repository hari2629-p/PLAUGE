Abstract:
Uncertainties in measurements probability distributions error analysis estimates of means and errors Monte Carlo techniques dependent and independent variables least-squares fit to a polynomial least-squares fit to an arbitrary function fitting composite peaks direct application of the maximum likelihood. Appendices: numerical methods matrices graphs and tables histograms and graphs computer routines in Pascal.
