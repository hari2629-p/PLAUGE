Natural Language Processing for Sentiment Analysis

Abstract: Sentiment analysis using natural language processing has become essential for 
understanding public opinion from social media, reviews, and feedback. This research 
explores various techniques including lexicon-based approaches, machine learning classifiers, 
and deep learning models for sentiment classification. We evaluate the performance of 
support vector machines, random forests, and recurrent neural networks on benchmark datasets. 
The study demonstrates that transformer-based models like BERT achieve state-of-the-art 
results in sentiment analysis tasks. Preprocessing steps including tokenization, stopword 
removal, and lemmatization significantly impact model performance. Applications range from 
brand monitoring to political analysis and customer feedback evaluation. The paper concludes 
with recommendations for practical implementation and future research directions in 
multilingual sentiment analysis.
