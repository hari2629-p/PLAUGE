Abstract:
Natural Language Processing (NLP) allows computers to comprehend, decode, and produce human language. This study examines text-centered communication and investigates approaches for analyzing electronic writings through techniques like finite-state automata, regular expressions, and grammars. The research emphasizes organized text processing and its ability to enhance human-computer interaction in digital environments
