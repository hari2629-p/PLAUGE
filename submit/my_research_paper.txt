Machine Learning Applications in Medical Diagnosis: A Review

Abstract: Machine learning has become a transformative technology in healthcare systems, 
enabling improved diagnostics, personalized treatment plans, and efficient resource allocation. 
This paper reviews the current state of machine learning applications in medical imaging, 
drug discovery, and patient outcome prediction. Deep learning algorithms, especially 
convolutional neural networks, have demonstrated remarkable accuracy in detecting diseases 
from medical images including X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans. Natural language processing 
is being used on electronic health records to extract valuable insights. The combination 
of machine learning with wearable technology enables continuous health monitoring. However, 
issues remain in data privacy, model interpretability, and regulatory approval. Future 
work should focus on creating explainable AI models that medical professionals 
can trust and understand.
